  # Meet Moni: The Mind Behind the 'Scape
      
  I am Tasia Miller, the creator of Moni’s Mindscape. I came up with this title because I think of my digital work as a different part of me that I would like to bring to life from the ever active reaches of my mind. Moni is just a nickname I’ve dubbed myself from my middle name. I went to university for Computer Information Sciences, previously having done Multimedia Production and Design. But that wasn’t always the case. I started out doing Video Production and Technology. Long story short, being behind a camera isn’t what I wanted to do with my creativity. Welcome to my little slice of heaven. :)
